Traditionally, allocating exam halls has been a time-consuming and error-prone task for administrators. With the Automatic Exam Hall Allocation System, this process is automated. This system allocates the exam halls based on various factors such as the number of participants, hall capacities, and scheduling constraints. The System could be used for both university exam administrations and internal assessments.<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Students 
                can easily access their exam hall information by entering their registration numbers into the system. This simple interface eliminates the need for students to manually inquire about their exam halls, reducing administrative burden and enhancing overall satisfaction.</span></span></td>
